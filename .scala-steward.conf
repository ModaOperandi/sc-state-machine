# pullRequests.frequency allows to control how often or when Scala Steward
# is allowed to create pull requests.
#
# Possible values:
#   @asap
#     PRs are created without delay.
#
#   @daily | @weekly | @monthly
#     PRs are created at least 1 day | 7 days | 30 days after the last PR.
#
#   <CRON expression>
#     PRs are created roughly according to the given CRON expression.
#
#     CRON expressions consist of five fields:
#     minutes, hour of day, day of month, month, and day of week.
#
#     See https://www.alonsodomin.me/cron4s/userguide/index.html#parsing for
#     more information about the CRON expressions that are supported.
#
#     Note that the date parts of the CRON expression are matched exactly
#     while the the time parts are only used to abide to the frequency of
#     the given expression.
#
# Default: @asap
#
pullRequests.frequency = "0 8 ? * 1" # every tuesday at 8am
